#django-admin startproject portfolio


Added a new Django app for portfolio sections:

#python manage.py startapp main

2️⃣ Project Configuration

Add import os in Setting.py @top

#STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'app', 'static'),
]

Set up the project’s urls.py and included app-level URLs for modular navigation.
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from app import views -->Import and include sub apps/views here.

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    #add views router along with function names here 
]
